# CodeJam - SAP Cloud Platform Workflow

## Description

This repository contains the material for the CodeJam on SAP Cloud Platform (CP) Workflow. Prequisites and recommendations for this CodeJam are documented in the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) file.

In this CodeJam you'll create, deploy and extend a workflow definition, and use it in the context of an SAP Fiori launchpad site, using the standard My Inbox app. You'll also monitor the workflow instances, and initiate them from a 3rd party app.

### Material organization

The material consists of a series of exercises that are to be done in order (each one building on the previous one). Each exercise is contained in a directory, with a main 'readme' file containing the core exercise instructions, with optional supporting files, such as screenshots and sample files.

### Following the exercises

During the CodeJam you will complete each exercise one at a time. At the end of each exercise there are questions; these are designed to help you think about the content just covered, and are to be discussed with the entire CodeJam class when everyone has finished that exercise.

If you finish an exercise early, please resist the temptation to continue with the next one. Instead, explore what you've just done and see if you can find out more about the subject that was covered. That way we all stay on track together and can benefit from some reflection via the questions (and answers).

:point_right: Where there's an action for you to perform, it will be prefixed with this pointing symbol, to help you focus on where you are in each exercise.
