# Exercise 01 - Setting up for Workflow on Cloud Foundry

In this exercise you'll set up and configure the basic aspects that you'll need to complete this Workflow CodeJam on SAP Cloud Platform, specifically in the Cloud Foundry (CF) environment.

From a service perspective, you'll be using a number of services:

- Workflow: the engine and infrastructure that supports workflow generally
- Portal: to support the Fiori Launchpad (FLP) site which will host the Workflow-related apps
- HTML5 Application Repository: where the core Workflow-related apps are stored and served from

You will also need an editor, or an Interactive Development Environment (IDE) to create and maintain your workflow definitions. For that you will be using:

- TODO

Finally, you'll be playing different roles throughout this CodeJam, using your SAP Cloud Platform trial user. To that end, you'll need the appropriate authorizations:

- Workflow Administrator
- Workflow Developer
- Workflow Initiator
- Workflow Participant
- Workflow Viewer

## Steps

After completing the steps in this exercise you'll have appropriate authorizations set up and assigned to your user, an IDE setup and configured to work with Workflow artifacts, and an instance of the main Workflow service set up explicitly. Instances of the other services mentioned earlier will be set up implicitly in the next exercise.
